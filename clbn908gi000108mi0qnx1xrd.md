# Dev Retro 2022!

The year 2022 has been a fantastic, blastic and bombastic one. This year was full of discovering new things in both development and mental/personal related fields. Let's use this great opportunity provided to us by Hashnode @[Syed Fazle Rahman](@fazlerocks) to look back and share our findings and learnings of 2022!

## ü´°Discovering DSA!

So I started this year exploring, learning and mastering DSA from multiple sources and gotta admit, it's crazyy. Started by remembering CPP basics and then learning topics from YouTube. [CodeHelp - by Babbar](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA) was one of the best sources for DSA using CPP and it helped me a lot in starting stages of my journey. Am saying "starting journey" because soon after starting DSA, my exams came and thus I had to drop it. For those wondering, I am an Electronics and Communication Major and failed to transfer to CSE or IT. (All because I didn't put a "/IT" in my request letter to the registrar). It hurt a lot but I accepted it and decided to move on with it because somewhere inside, I do want to learn about computer hardware as well which has been a field of interest for me since childhood.

## üòíXams a Bi\*ch!

Yeah, we all agree on this one huh! Apart from me being lazy, exams have been one of the biggest reasons for me being not able to work on stuff I want to. ECE demands time, effort and focus to maintain an average scgpa of 8. So, I need to focus on the ECE part a lot which made my progress a lot slower.

## ü´°Discovering THE Amazing World Of WEB!

Now, in my 3rd semester this year, my friend suggested exploring WEB. Well, I didn't have any resources to try and experiment but well, being a great friend @[Ankit Mishra](@ankitmishraexe) , he even provided me with some great sources and content. So, my journey began. I haven't done anything insanely significant in this field as of yet but am working on projects slowly and steadily while trying to maintain an average scgpa of 8 in ECE. My first self-made tribute website will be up in a few days! (Follow me on Twitter to check it out!!!) Anyways, my goal for this year was to at least experiment up till bootstrap which is still learning so hopefully, I'll achieve it!

## ‚≠êWrapup!

Well, it's been a hell of a year. Many significant things happened this year. Many personal, many professional. Haven't achieved anything significant this year, but one thing is for sure, this year has been one of the best so far! (for me personally). I hope all of you achieve your goals by the end of this year and be in the best form you can be in! I also hope 2023 brings new achievements and goals to conquer and new tech to experiment with! (even though I've not even touched all of this available tech to me). Thanks 2022!
